## About Me

I received my B.S. in Molecular and Cellular Biology from University of Illionis at Urbana-Champaign in 2021, where I studied phage induction in *P. aeruginosa* at Whitaker lab. I received my M.S. in Computational Biology from Carnegie Mellon University in 2023, where I studied evolutionary patterns in mammals by applying machine learning methods on enhancer activities at Pfenning lab. I am currently a bioinformatician of the Microbio department, at the University of Pennsylvania, where I helped different groups processing and analyzing sequencing data, with a specific focus on multiome single-cell RNA-seq.
