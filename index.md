Hi! My name is Tianyu Lu and welcome to my academic homepage.

### About Me

I received my B.S. in Molecular and Cellular Biology from University of Illionis at Urbana-Champaign at 2017, where I studied phage induction in p. aeruginosa at Whitaker lab. I received my M.S. in Computational Biology from Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied evolutionary patterns in mammals by applying machine learning methods on enhancer activities at Pfenning lab. I am currently a bioinformatician of the Microbio deparment, at the University of Pennsylvania, where I helped different groups processing and analyzing sequencing data, with a specific focus on multiome RNA-seq.
